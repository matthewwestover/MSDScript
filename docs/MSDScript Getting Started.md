## MSDScript Getting Started
Via the commandline, inside the MSDScript folder execute the following:  

```cmake .``` Initializes the make file process  
```make``` Creates the MSDScript executable and MSDLib library file

The MSDScript executable file will take prompts via the commandline or from an input file. See the ```docs/example``` folder for example ```.msd``` files that can be executed. 

**Note**: Both the ```count.msd``` and ```countdown.msd``` example files require the executable to be running in **Step** mode to execute properly. Standard running results in a seg fault for these examples. For more information please see the User Guide.
